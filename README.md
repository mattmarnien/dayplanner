# dayplanner

This app is a single-day planner broken down by hours from 8 am to 6 pm. The app allows users to edit the text in the main column to enter things to do. The right column will save the event entered in the matching row. The events are stores in local storage and will persist through refreshes.
 The app also checks the time against the schedule and styles the page to show time blocks that have passed, the current time block, and future events.
